## Important Dates

**Code Submission Deadline**: First half of July.  Deadlines are announced at least two weeks before.

**Presentation**: 1 week after code submission

## Your Group (*Update this Information*)

Submitted by Group XX:

- Name1
- Name2
- Name3
- Name4

By submitting this exercise, you confirm the following:

- **All people** listed above **contributed** to this solution
- **No other people** were **involved** in this solution
- **No contents** of this solution were **copied from others** (this includes people, large language models, websites, etc.)

## Regulations

Students are strictly prohibited from copying assignments or using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for project solutions. Violations will result in disqualification from the exam. Submit original work only.

## Instructions:

1. For each notebook in `notebooks/` folder, complete the TODO sections.
2. Prepare final demo and presentation.

## Solution requirements

- Only use the provided imports, no additional libraries are allowed.
- Do not change the structure and filenames provided within the notebooks. You can add additional methods for better code-readability if you require, but they should be called from within the provided framework.
- Your code needs to **compile**, **run**, and produce an **output**.
- Make sure that we can run your code without any changes. For example, do not use hard-coded file/folder paths.
- The output should contain the final image or demo video showcasing the task-specific requirements. The code for visualizing the outputs has already been provided. Additionally, make sure to **save your generated outputs** in the `data/output/` folder.
- Your code should not be unnecessarily inefficient.

## Submission Format

Please hand in a single **.zip** file named according to the pattern "**groupXX**" (e.g. group00). The contents of the .zip should be as follows:

- folder with the same name as the **.zip** file 
  - **part1.ipynb** file
  - **part2.ipynb** file
  - **.html** export of each .ipynb with all the outputs you got
  - **data** folder containing necessary files to run the code and the outputs

I.e.

1. **unzip** the provided project.zip file
2. **rename** folder "project" according to the pattern "groupXX"
3. **solve** task inside the corresponding .ipynb file
4. **export** notebook as .html (File > Download as > HTML)
5. **zip** folder groupXX
6. **submit** groupXX.zip

## Final Presentation

You will be required to present your solution in a 20-minute presentation, which includes:

- Problem Overview of each part
- Solution Overview of each part (e.g. pseudocode, mathematical formulas, visualizations)
- Describe challenges & optimizations

After the presentation, there will be 10 minutes of questions and answers about your work.
